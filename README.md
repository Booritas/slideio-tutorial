# SlideIO Tutorials

Welcome to the SlideIO Tutorials repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as tutorials for using the SlideIO library. SlideIO is a library for reading and manipulating digital pathology slides. The tutorials cover various aspects of SlideIO, including image reading, metadata extraction, conversion to different formats, color transformation, and filter transformation.

## Tutorials

The following tutorials are included in this repository:

- [general.ipynb](./general.ipynb): This notebook provides an introduction to SlideIO and covers the basics of using the library. It demonstrates how to read images, extract metadata, and perform other common tasks.
